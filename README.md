# Sorting Cap
## What Is Sorting Cap?
Sorting Cap is a project that allows users to fill out a questionaire about their preferences for higher education. It then provides the user with a list of colleges that meet their preferences.
The project, while not in development, was for the Nebraska Tech Builder's Challenge, a hackathon taking place in Seward Nebraska. 
The project won an honorable mention for product development.
